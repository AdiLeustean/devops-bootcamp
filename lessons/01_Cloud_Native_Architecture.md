# Course intro
Welcome!
## Goals

* Get new people interested in software infrastructure
* Provide an update on where the industry is heading
* Try to piece togheter parts of infastructure to solve problems
* Hopefully, by the end you will have an idea of what DevOps is, it's role and get interested in infastrucutre development.

## Organization

* We will get together each Friday for 2 hours.
* Work will continue between these meetings.
  * We'll try to collaborate using slack.
  * If we get stuck we'll spend the first 15 minutes of each meeting to try and fix them.
* Courses will cover mostly the theory of how things work, what problem do they solve and the solution space.

# Cloud Native Architecture

## What is a cloud native architecture

### The CNCF perspective:
Cloud native computing uses an open source software stack to be:
* Containerized. Each part (applications, processes, etc) is packaged in its own container. This facilitates reproducibility, transparency, and resource isolation.
* Dynamically orchestrated. Containers are actively scheduled and managed to optimize resource utilization.
* Microservices oriented. Applications are segmented into microservices. This significantly increases the overall agility and maintainability of applications.

## Walking though the application stack

* A good place to start is the CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) landscape project: https://github.com/cncf/landscape
